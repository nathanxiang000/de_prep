## What would be your metrics to evaluate the success of instagram reels? then pick the final north start metric. answer in a GAME structure

### GAME Framework for Evaluating Instagram Reels

**Goal**  
Establish Instagram Reels as a leading short-form video platform, directly competing with TikTok, by driving both creator and viewer engagement within the broader Instagram ecosystem[3][5][6].

**Actions**  
- Encourage creators to produce and share high-quality, engaging Reels content by offering robust editing tools, discoverability, and monetization opportunities[3][4].
- Promote Reels to viewers through integration in the Explore page, Feed, and Stories, maximizing reach and exposure[5][8].
- Foster a feedback loop where increased viewer engagement motivates more creators to participate, and vice versa[6].

**Metrics**  
To measure success for both creators and viewers, track:

- **For Creators:**
  - Number of active Reel creators (weekly/monthly)
  - Average Reels posted per creator
  - Creator retention rate
  - Average reach per Reel
  - Monetization adoption (e.g., branded content, shopping features)[3][5]

- **For Viewers:**
  - Daily/weekly/monthly active Reel viewers
  - Average watch time per user/session
  - Number of Reels viewed per session
  - Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares, saves)[6][8]
  - Viewer retention (returning to watch Reels over time)

- **Ecosystem/Platform:**
  - Total Reels created and viewed
  - Virality metrics (shares, external links)
  - Cross-engagement with other Instagram surfaces (e.g., Stories, Feed)[5][8]

**Evaluation (North Star Metric)**  
The ultimate success of Instagram Reels hinges on its ability to drive sustained, meaningful engagement that benefits both creators and viewers, and differentiates it from TikTok. Therefore, the **North Star Metric** should be:

### Total Time Spent Watching Reels per Day

- This metric directly reflects both the breadth (number of users) and depth (engagement level) of Reels consumption.
- It captures the value delivered to viewers (entertainment, discovery) and indirectly incentivizes creators (more views, higher potential for growth and monetization).
- It aligns with Instagram’s goal of making Reels a core, sticky part of the user experience, and is a key battleground with TikTok, where engagement time is a primary competitive lever[3][6][8].

**Why not just views or number of Reels?**  
Views alone can be gamed or reflect superficial engagement, while time spent better captures true user interest and platform stickiness. It also encourages product improvements that make Reels more compelling, benefiting both creators and viewers.
