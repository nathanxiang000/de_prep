Python:
Also similar to screening questions. Focus more on calculating metrics using python. You're allowed to use built in sort. Think about how you would store the data and what kind of data structure you would use to derive to the solution. Leetcode doesn't have these type of questions.
dict, list, tuple, sort, for loops, set

Ownership
5 signals they're looking, expect one to two question for each. Prepare stories for each scenario with impact and quantifiable metrics. Follow up questions will be asked if your answer doesn't give the signal they're looking for. Be ready to adapt your story to the question. Sometimes the question might not apply to you but you have to shape your existing story to match and give meaningful result. Very important interview!

Final word: The questions aren't difficult but you're fighting against the clock. Getting hint is not a bad thing, using them well is a sign of learning abilities, a skill they're looking for. Practice speaking out loud. Recommend mock interviews. My interviewers were very nice and everything felt pretty smooth.
